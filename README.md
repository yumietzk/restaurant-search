A restaurant search application created with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.  
It fetches data from Yelp Fusion API and users current position using Geolocation API, so users can search restaurants near them. Users also can see restaurant's detail which is from opening hours to the location on map, and if they like it they can save the restaurant on bookmark which stores data on localstorage.  
This project uses MVC pattern.
